# KatyDOM
A virtual DOM for Kotlin. A statically typed HTML-generating DSL.

KatyDOM is still in progress, but its aim is to work much like kotlin.html but for the browser
with a virtual DOM. KatyDOM includes API that lets it participate in an Elm-like architecture
or it can be used as part of any architecture needing a virtual DOM with a build/patch/patch/...
lifecycle.
